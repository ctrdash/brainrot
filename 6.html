        <center><b>The Simple Social Media Service That Got Too Greedy (Simpleverse)</b></center>
        <center><p>Have you ever thought that staples of social media were too complicated? Like posting, for example.</p></center>
        <center><p>For the people who wanted a simpler experience, an unknown person launched a social media platform</p></center>
        <center><p>called Simpleverse. The service launched on April 6th, 2024 at 1:31AM. The platform lacked many </p></center>
        <center><p>"complicated" features such as posting, account creation and more. Somehow, the website became a hit.</p></center>
        <center><p>6 days after the service launched, version 1.1 released, adding a code of condut. This code of conduct</p></center>
        <center><p>primarily banned terms commonly used on the video platform "TickTock", like "charisma", "ski-ba-bop", and</p></center>
        <center><p>"phantom tax." 2 days later, v1.2 released, simply updating the code of conduct. 1.3 added features like</p></center>
        <center><p>sign up page, and a "Why Us?" page. At this point, Simpleverse was hacked, and certain pages were compromised.</p></center>
        <center><p>All of the changes the hacker made were instantly reverted. The most controversial change happened 2 days before</p></center>
        <center><p>the service's eventual shutdown. The CEO of Simpleverse integrated advertisements into the platform. Users</p></center>
        <center><p>found ads on every single page. This change was later modified, where all advertisements were moved to a</p></center>
        <center><p>"sponsors" page. A newsletter was added shortly after. A public apology for the ads was posted onto</p></center>
        <center><p>the newsletter. A day later, Simpleverse added a subscription model to the service. Later that day,</p></center>
        <center><p>it was announced that the Simpleverse service would end. Simpleverse shutdown on April 25th, 2024.</p></center>
        <center><p>When asked about Simpleverse, the unknown CEO said that "an archive of the site was made" and he's</p></center>
        <center><p>working on making it public. He said this 2 months ago. To this day, Simpleverse's database is still</p></center>
        <center><p>available to this unknown CEO, but he has not released any of it yet.</p></center>
