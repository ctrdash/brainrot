        <center><p>website. The creator of the website says "This website shouldn't be taken seriously. I'm probably</p></center>
        <center><p>going to forget to update the articles at some point." Brainrot News publishes 3 articles a month,</p></center>
        <center><p>and the 3 previous articles are sent to the "Archives" page.</p></center>
