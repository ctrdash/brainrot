        <center><b>Tyler Blevins Has Quit Fortnite</b></center>
        <center><p>A few days ago, popular fortnite streamer Tyler Blevins was playing a solo game. He landed</p></center>
        <center><p>at Grim Gate. While he was fighting the Cerberus boss, who drops the mythic Gatekeeper Shotgun,</p></center>
        <center><p>a player who goes by the name of DarkVoid2234 pushed Grim Gate using one of the season's many</p></center>
        <center><p>vehicles. DarkVoid2234 abused one of Fortnite's new weapons, known as the Nitro Fists. Many people</p></center>
        <center><p>online say the Nitro Fists need to be vaulted, and clearly Blevins agrees with this. DarkVoid2234</p></center>
        <center><p>destroyed Blevins using the new Nitro Fists. From there, Blevins immediately closed the game and shut</p></center>
        <center><p>his stream off. We attempted to contact both Blevins and DarkVoid2234, but neither of them have responded.</p></center>
        <center><p>A YouTube channel that goes by the name of Daily Clips Central uploaded the clip of Blevins quitting</p></center>
        <center><p>the game. You can watch the clip in the embedded video below. Credits to Daily Clips Central (Youtube) and</p></center>
