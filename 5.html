        <center><b>Should Nintendo Reopen The "Miiverse" (DISCUSSION)</b></center>
        <center><p>The following was a privately-held discussion between Mark Smith and Jake Smith.</p></center>
        <center><p>Mark: Hey, welcome to the Brainrot Discussion. Recently, a relic from the Wii U era has gone viral.</p></center>
        <center><p>Jake: What do you mean?</p></center>
        <center><p>Mark: Elon Musk, the CEO of Twitter (2022-Present) recently made the decision to hide likes.</p></center>
        <center><p>Jake: Well that's kinda dumb.</p></center>
        <center><p>Mark: It is, so people rebelled by posting images of the "Yeah!" button that Miiverse used.</p></center>
        <center><p>Jake: What's Miiverse?</p></center>
        <center><p>Mark: Miiverse was a social media platform for Nintendo's Wii U and 3DS consoles. It got shut down</p></center>
        <center><p>back in 2017. Nintendo claimed it was because of "people moving to other platforms" but I believe it</p></center>
        <center><p>was because of the posts people made on the Miiverse.</p></center>
        <center><p>Jake: What kind of posts were made?</p></center>
        <center><p>Mark: Some posts were bad, others were just kind of dumb. We won't get into the posts in specific though.</p></center>
        <center><p>Jake: Ok.</p></center>
